      Nara Chandrababu Naidu Telugu pronunciation: [Ààn…ëÀêr…ëÀê Ààt É ånÀådr…ëÀê Ààb…ëÀêbuÀê
      Ààna…™duÀê] (born 20 April 1950), commonly known as CBN, is a prominent
      Indian politician who is currently serving as the 13th Chief Minister of
      Andhra Pradesh. He was democratically elected to this position with a
      landslide victory in 2024. Naidu has had a distinguished political career,
      previously serving as Chief Minister from 1995 to 2004 before the state's
      bifurcation and again from 2014 to 2019 after the bifurcation. In addition
      to his terms as Chief Minister, Naidu served as the Leader of the
      Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 2004 to 2014
      and from 2019 to 2024. His leadership has been pivotal in shaping the
      political landscape of Andhra Pradesh over the past few decades. Since
      2015, Naidu has held the position of national president of the Telugu
      Desam Party (TDP), underlining his influential role within the party and
      his continued commitment to its ideals and objectives. His tenure in
      various capacities has been marked by significant contributions to the
      development and modernization of Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the areas
      of infrastructure and technology. Naidu's political career began in the
      1970s with the Indian National Congress. In 1978, he was elected to the
      Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, and from 1980 to 1982, he served as a
      minister in the state cabinet. Afterwards, he switched party allegiance
      and joined TDP, which had been founded by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao his
      father in law.[3] Naidu served as a TDP Member of the Legislative Assembly
      (MLA) from 1989 to 1995, during which period he became a high-profile
      opposition leader.[4] In 1995, he became the Chief Minister of Andhra
      Pradesh. During his two terms as Chief Minister, Naidu's public image was
      that of an economic reformer and proponent of information technology-based
      economic growth. His policies brought modernisation and investments
      particularly to Hyderabad, where he directed the founding of HITEC
      City.[3] He also had a role in national politics, first as the convener of
      the United Front in 1996. He supported the Bharatiya Janata Party
      (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the 1999 Lok Sabha
      elections, in which TDP won 29 seats, enhancing Naidu's reputation as a
      nationally prominent politician. In 2014, after having been the leader of
      opposition during the whole intervening period, Naidu returned as Chief
      Minister, winning in the now-residuary (due to bifurcation) Andhra
      Pradesh. Between 2014 and 2019, he developed the basic infrastructure for
      new Andhra Pradesh, brought in several big-ticket foreign investments such
      as Kia Motors and created thousands of jobs for the state's youth.[5] In
      the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, Naidu's party faced
      an electoral setback, with TDP winning only 23 out of 175 seats.[6] In
      September 2023, Naidu was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department
      (CID) police in Andhra Pradesh due to alleged involvement in the skills
      development case and was granted bail by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in
      November 2023.[7]
